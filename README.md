## Introduction 

The project consists of two different approaches: the first one is the classic view on the topic of rumor
diffusion via a system dynamics approach modeled like the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered)
model defined by Kermack and McKendrik, while the other one is a take on the agent-based model,
having in mind the same structure of the first one, yet exploiting the possibility of managing each
individual singularly.

In this project I decided to study two different simulation models: a system dynamics
approach which is more common for the nature of the problem whose aspect will be highlighted after
and an agent-based model in which I consider a new view on the problem, based on the common
assumption that “the like seeks the like”, from the latin phrase “similia similibus curentur”. In this
approach I consider that each individual tends to believe only those similar to him, with respect to
their educational level, which can be seen as a summa of one’s beliefs, cultural level as well as
academic achievements. Moreover, despite the classical SIR (Susceptible Infected Recovered) model
on rumor spreading, I consider another possible actor: the Counters, whose job is to restrain the
spreading of the starting rumor, by spreading a counter-rumor in turn.
The focus of the project is to study and analyze the duration of a rumor as a function of the average
educational level.
